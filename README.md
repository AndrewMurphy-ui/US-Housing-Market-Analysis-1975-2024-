🏡 U.S. House Price Growth Analysis (1975–2024)
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of house price growth trends across U.S. states over a 49-year period (from Q1 1975 to Q1 2024). Historical housing index data was extracted, cleaned, and analyzed using a PostgreSQL database (House_db) to identify long-term appreciation trends and regional performance patterns. The primary focus is on Montana, a state that has demonstrated exceptional growth, alongside comparative insights from other high-performing states like Utah, Washington, and Oregon.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Database: PostgreSQL (House_db)

Language: SQL (data extraction & transformation)

Visualization: Power BI / Matplotlib (optional for visuals)

Metrics: Calculated percentage growth, total index growth, and quarterly growth rates

📊 Key Metrics for Montana
Metric	Value
Total Index Growth	492.41
Percentage Growth	260.15%
Average Quarterly Growth	0.64

Total Index Growth measures the change in Montana’s housing price index from 1975 to 2024.

Percentage Growth captures the overall proportional increase in house prices over the 49-year span.

Quarterly Growth reflects the average increase in index points per quarter.

📌 Key Insights
🔝 Top States by Total Growth (1975–2024)
Based on total index growth, the top four states are:

Montana

Utah

Washington

Oregon

Montana ranks #1 in total index growth, highlighting its remarkable long-term appreciation in property values. This trend may reflect a combination of factors including increased migration, changing lifestyle preferences, and economic development in the Mountain West region.

🔍 Additional Observations
Steady Growth Pattern: Montana’s housing market shows consistent quarterly increases with relatively low volatility, indicating stable demand over time.

Post-2000 Acceleration: A significant portion of the growth occurred after the year 2000, suggesting increased regional attractiveness or demographic shifts.

Comparison to National Trends: While the U.S. average also shows steady growth, Montana’s growth rate outpaces national averages and stands out among all 50 states.
